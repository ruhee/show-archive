I've been keeping a list of shows I've attended and played since 2006. This is that list.

`/full/` contains a list of every artists I've seen, and every artist I've performed with, in separate lists:

- `seen`: Every artist I have seen live in alphabetical order, including number of times.
- `seen-livestream`: Every artist who I've seen in livestream format rather than live in person (there was a pandemic, we all did what we could).
- `performed`: Every artist/group I've been on stage with in some capacity. `(as guest)` indicates I wasn't there as a full member but joined for some part of the performance. 
- `massey-hall`: I used to be an usher there and it's fun to brag about which shows I saw on the job.

`/years/` contains the list of shows by year (in chronological order).
